Together with Wilhelm Treschow and as part of the NMT-days 2024 at Lund University, I gave the talk *The shape of water:  the maths of fluids in video games and movies*. Here, you can find the slides. Thanks a lot to the organizers for organizing such an amazing event and thanks to all the students to come to our talks.
