I am a post-doctor in mathematics at the LTH at Lunds Universitet. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from Universität Bonn in 2022, supervised by Juan J. L. Velázquez.

My research focuses on the study of nonlinear PDEs arising from asymptotic models in fluid dynamics describing the dynamical behaviour of free interfaces. Mainly, I am working on thin-film models in various geometries, rheologies and considering different physical effects. My main interests include:

- the modelling of physically relevant situations in various scaling limits
- the analysis of stationary states and emerging patterns
- the analysis of stability and instability phenonema and the long-time behaviour of solutions
- modulating fronts and amplitude equations
- questions on existence and uniqueness of classical and weak solutions

In more detail, I am currently working on emerging patterns for the thermocapillary Bénard-Marangoni problem. Furthermore, I work on the non-Newtonian classical thin-film equation. In the past, I have also worked on stochastic homogenisation in perforated domains.
