I am a post-doctor in mathematics at Lunds Universitet. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from Universität Bonn in 2022, supervised 
by Juan J. L. Velázquez.

My research focuses on the study of PDEs arising from  asymptotic models in fluid dynamics. Mainly, I study thin-film models in 
various geometries and rheologies.
