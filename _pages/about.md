Welcome! My name is Jonas Jansen. I am a mathematician and science communicator. I work in Marketing and Communications at Fraunhofer SCAI. There, I am also responsible for the promotion of young talents.

As of September 2024, I have left academia. My research focusses on the study of nonlinear PDEs describing the dynamical behaviour of free interfaces, mainly thin-film equations. I am still doing research from time to time and I am still pursuing the study of thermocapillary thin-film models and pattern formation.

I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from Universität Bonn in 2022, supervised by Juan J. L. Velázquez. From 2022 to 2024, I have been a PostDoc at the LTH at Lunds Universitet. In the past, I have worked on stochastic homogenisation in perforated domains and the dynamics of thin-film models. Currently, in my free time, I am still working on emerging patterns for the Bénard–Marangoni problem.

I have always found the communication of mathematical research of outmost importance. While working in academia, I really enjoyed teaching students for over 10 years. Traces of my teaching activities and (unfortunately still unpolished) lecture notes can still be found on this webpage. Now, I am working as a science communicator at Fraunhofer SCAI. This includes the promotion of young talents. I will share more information about my new activities soon.
