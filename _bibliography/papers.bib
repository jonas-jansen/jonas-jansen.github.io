	abstract = {We study the  homogenization of the Dirichlet problem for the Stokes equations in $\R^3$ perforated by $m$ spherical particles. 
	We assume the positions and velocities of the particles to be identically and independently distributed random variables.
	In the critical regime, when the radii of the particles are of order $m^{-1}$, the
	homogenization limit $u$  is given as the solution to the Brinkman equations.
	We provide optimal rates for the convergence $u_m \to u$ in $L^2$, namely $m^{-\beta}$ for all $\beta < 1/2$. Moreover, we consider the fluctuations. In the central limit scaling, we show that these converge to a Gaussian field, locally in $L^2(\R^3)$,
	with an explicit covariance. 
	
	Our analysis is based on  explicit approximations for the solutions $u_m$ in terms of $u$ as well as the particle positions and their velocities. These are shown to be accurate in $\dot H^1(\R^3)$ to order $m^{-\beta}$ for all $\beta < 1$.
	Our results also apply to the analogous problem regarding the homogenization of the Poisson equations.},

	abstract = {We study the gradient-flow structure of a non-Newtonian thin film equation with power-law rheology. The equation is quasilinear, of fourth order and doubly-degenerate parabolic. By adding a singular potential to the natural Dirichlet energy, we introduce a modified version of the thin-film equation. Then, we set up a minimising-movement scheme that converges to global positive weak solutions to the modified problem. These solutions satisfy an energy-dissipation equality and follow a gradient flow. In the limit of a vanishing singularity of the potential, we obtain global non-negative weak solutions to the power-law thin-film equation {\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\} {\textbackslash}partial\_t u + {\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textbackslash}bigl(m(u) {\textbar}{\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textasciicircum}3 u - G{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}(u) {\textbackslash}partial\_x u{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{α-1\} {\textbackslash}bigl({\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textasciicircum}3 u - G{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}(u) {\textbackslash}partial\_x u{\textbackslash}bigr){\textbackslash}bigr) = 0 {\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} with potential \$G\$ in the shear-thinning (\$α\&gt; 1\$), Newtonian (\$α= 1\$) and shear-thickening case (\$0 \&lt;α\&lt; 1\$). The latter satisfy an energy-dissipation inequality. Finally, we derive dissipation bounds in the case \$G{\textbackslash}equiv 0\$ which imply that solutions emerging from initial values with low energy lift up uniformly in finite time.},

	journaltitle = {Nonlinearity},
	abstract = {We study stationary, periodic solutions to the thermocapillary thin-film model which can be derived from the Bénard–Marangoni problem via a lubrication approximation. When the Marangoni number M increases beyond a critical value , the constant solution becomes spectrally unstable via a (conserved) long-wave instability and periodic stationary solutions bifurcate. For a fixed period, we find that these solutions lie on a global bifurcation curve of stationary, periodic solutions with a fixed wave number and mass. Furthermore, we show that the stationary periodic solutions on the global bifurcation branch converge to a weak stationary periodic solution which exhibits film rupture. The proofs rely on a Hamiltonian formulation of the stationary problem and the use of analytic global bifurcation theory. Finally, we show the instability of the bifurcating solutions close to the bifurcation point and give a formal derivation of the amplitude equation governing the dynamics close to the onset of instability.},
