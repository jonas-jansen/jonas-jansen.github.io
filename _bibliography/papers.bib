	abstract = {We study the  homogenization of the Dirichlet problem for the Stokes equations in $\R^3$ perforated by $m$ spherical particles. 
	We assume the positions and velocities of the particles to be identically and independently distributed random variables.
	In the critical regime, when the radii of the particles are of order $m^{-1}$, the
	homogenization limit $u$  is given as the solution to the Brinkman equations.
	We provide optimal rates for the convergence $u_m \to u$ in $L^2$, namely $m^{-\beta}$ for all $\beta < 1/2$. Moreover, we consider the fluctuations. In the central limit scaling, we show that these converge to a Gaussian field, locally in $L^2(\R^3)$,
	with an explicit covariance. 
	
	Our analysis is based on  explicit approximations for the solutions $u_m$ in terms of $u$ as well as the particle positions and their velocities. These are shown to be accurate in $\dot H^1(\R^3)$ to order $m^{-\beta}$ for all $\beta < 1$.
	Our results also apply to the analogous problem regarding the homogenization of the Poisson equations.},

	abstract = {We study the gradient-flow structure of a non-Newtonian thin film equation with power-law rheology. The equation is quasilinear, of fourth order and doubly-degenerate parabolic. By adding a singular potential to the natural Dirichlet energy, we introduce a modified version of the thin-film equation. Then, we set up a minimising-movement scheme that converges to global positive weak solutions to the modified problem. These solutions satisfy an energy-dissipation equality and follow a gradient flow. In the limit of a vanishing singularity of the potential, we obtain global non-negative weak solutions to the power-law thin-film equation {\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\} {\textbackslash}partial\_t u + {\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textbackslash}bigl(m(u) {\textbar}{\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textasciicircum}3 u - G{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}(u) {\textbackslash}partial\_x u{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{α-1\} {\textbackslash}bigl({\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textasciicircum}3 u - G{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}(u) {\textbackslash}partial\_x u{\textbackslash}bigr){\textbackslash}bigr) = 0 {\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} with potential \$G\$ in the shear-thinning (\$α\&gt; 1\$), Newtonian (\$α= 1\$) and shear-thickening case (\$0 \&lt;α\&lt; 1\$).

Finally, we derive dissipation bounds in the case \$G{\textbackslash}equiv 0\$ which imply that solutions emerging from initial values with low energy lift up uniformly in finite time.},

	abstract = {We study stationary, periodic solutions to the thermocapillary thin-film model which can be derived from the Bénard–Marangoni problem via a lubrication approximation. When the Marangoni number M increases beyond a critical value , the constant solution becomes spectrally unstable via a (conserved) long-wave instability and periodic stationary solutions bifurcate. For a fixed period, we find that these solutions lie on a global bifurcation curve of stationary, periodic solutions with a fixed wave number and mass. Furthermore, we show that the stationary periodic solutions on the global bifurcation branch converge to a weak stationary periodic solution which exhibits film rupture. The proofs rely on a Hamiltonian formulation of the stationary problem and the use of analytic global bifurcation theory. Finally, we show the instability of the bifurcating solutions close to the bifurcation point and give a formal derivation of the amplitude equation governing the dynamics close to the onset of instability.},

  abstract = {We study the bifurcation of planar patterns and fast-moving pattern interfaces in an asymptotic long-wave model for the three-dimensional Bénard–Marangoni problem, which is close to a Turing instability with an additional neutral mode at \$\$k = 0\$\$. We derive the model from the full free-boundary Bénard–Marangoni problem for a thin liquid film on a heated substrate of low thermal conductivity via a lubrication approximation. This yields a quasilinear, fully coupled, mixed-order degenerate-parabolic system for the film height and temperature. As the Marangoni number M increases beyond a critical value \$\$M\textasciicircum *\$\$, the pure conduction state destabilizes via a Turing(–Hopf) instability. Close to this critical value, we formally derive a system of amplitude equations which govern the slow modulation dynamics of square or hexagonal patterns. Using center manifold theory, we then study the bifurcation of square and hexagonal planar patterns. Finally, we construct planar fast-moving modulating traveling front solutions that model the transition between two planar patterns. The proof uses a spatial dynamics formulation and a center manifold reduction to a finite-dimensional invariant manifold, where modulating fronts appear as heteroclinic orbits. These modulating fronts facilitate a possible mechanism for pattern formation, as previously observed in experiments.},

The magnetic potential is assumed to be $C^2$ and asymptotically periodic along the unbounded direction, with an algebraic decay rate towards a periodic background potential. Under the condition that the embedded eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator lies away from the thresholds of the continuous spectrum, we show that the set of nearby potentials for which the embedded eigenvalue persists forms a smooth manifold of finite and even codimension. The proof employs tools from Floquet theory, exponential dichotomies, and Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction. Additionally, we give an example of a potential which satisfies the assumptions of our main theorem.},

For any fixed absolute wave number \$k\_0\$, we find that square and hexagonal patterns bifurcate from the flat surface profile at \$M=M\textasciicircum * + 4k\_0\textasciicircum 2\$. Using analytic global bifurcation theory, we show that the local bifurcation curves can be extended to global curves of square and hexagonal patterns with constant absolute wave number and mass. We exclude that the global bifurcation curves are closed loops through a global bifurcation in cones argument, which also establishes nodal properties for the solutions. Furthermore, assuming that the Marangoni number is uniformly bounded on the bifurcation branch, we prove that solutions exhibit film rupture, that is, their minimal height tends to zero. This assumption is substantiated by numerical experiments.},
