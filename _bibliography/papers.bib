	abstract = {We study the gradient-flow structure of a non-Newtonian thin film equation with power-law rheology. The equation is quasilinear, of fourth order and doubly-degenerate parabolic. By adding a singular potential to the natural Dirichlet energy, we introduce a modified version of the thin-film equation. Then, we set up a minimising-movement scheme that converges to global positive weak solutions to the modified problem. These solutions satisfy an energy-dissipation equality and follow a gradient flow. In the limit of a vanishing singularity of the potential, we obtain global non-negative weak solutions to the power-law thin-film equation {\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\} {\textbackslash}partial\_t u + {\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textbackslash}bigl(m(u) {\textbar}{\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textasciicircum}3 u - G{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}(u) {\textbackslash}partial\_x u{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{α-1\} {\textbackslash}bigl({\textbackslash}partial\_x{\textasciicircum}3 u - G{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}(u) {\textbackslash}partial\_x u{\textbackslash}bigr){\textbackslash}bigr) = 0 {\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} with potential \$G\$ in the shear-thinning (\$α\&gt; 1\$), Newtonian (\$α= 1\$) and shear-thickening case (\$0 \&lt;α\&lt; 1\$). The latter satisfy an energy-dissipation inequality. Finally, we derive dissipation bounds in the case \$G{\textbackslash}equiv 0\$ which imply that solutions emerging from initial values with low energy lift up uniformly in finite time.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08231},
	abstract = {We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to quasilinear doubly degenerate parabolic problems of fourth order. The equations model for instance the dynamic behaviour of a non-Newtonian thin-film flow on a flat impermeable bottom and with zero contact angle. We consider a shear-rate dependent fluid the rheology of which is described by a constitutive power-law or Ellis-law for the fluid viscosity. In all three cases, positive constants (i.e. positive flat films) are the only positive steady-state solutions. Moreover, we can give a detailed picture of the long-time behaviour of solutions with respect to the \$H{\textasciicircum}1({\textbackslash}Omega)\$-norm. In the case of shear-thickening power-law fluids, one observes that solutions which are initially close to a steady state, converge to equilibrium in finite time. In the shear-thinning power-law case, we find that steady states are polynomially stable in the sense that, as time tends to infinity, solutions which are initially close to a steady state, converge to equilibrium at rate \$1/t{\textasciicircum}\{1/{\textbackslash}beta\}\$ for some \${\textbackslash}beta {\textgreater} 0\$. Finally, in the case of an Ellis-fluid, steady states are exponentially stable in \$H{\textasciicircum}1({\textbackslash}Omega)\$.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04111},
	abstract = {We study the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem for the Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ perforated by $m$ spherical particles. We assume the positions and velocities of the particles to be identically and independently distributed random variables. In the critical regime, when the radii of the particles are of order \$m{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, the homogenization limit \$u\$ is given as the solution to the Brinkman equations. We provide optimal rates for the convergence \$u\_m {\textbackslash}to u\$ in \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$, namely \$m{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}beta\}\$ for all \${\textbackslash}beta {\textless} 1/2\$. Moreover, we consider the fluctuations. In the central limit scaling, we show that these converge to a Gaussian field, locally in \$L{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}3)\$, with an explicit covariance. Our analysis is based on explicit approximations for the solutions \$u\_m\$ in terms of \$u\$ as well as the particle positions and their velocities. These are shown to be accurate in \${\textbackslash}dot H{\textasciicircum}1({\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}3)\$ to order \$m{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}beta\}\$ for all \${\textbackslash}beta {\textless} 1\$. Our results also apply to the analogous problem regarding the homogenization of the Poisson equations.},
