- title: The water-wave problem (and its many shapes)

  abstract: In this talk I will introduce the classical water wave problem, modelled by the incompressible Euler equations with a free boundary (the water surface). The focus will be on the two-dimensional irrotational problem. The problem has a very long history, going back to the 18th century, but I will try to give a summary of the type of questions that have been studied by mathematicians and some important open questions that still remain.

  abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation appears as an asymptotic model to describe the dynamics of small, long-wavelength water waves. In this talk, I will formally derive the KdV equation as an amplitude equation for the water wave problem. The derivation is based on a multiple-scaling ansatz for solutions of the water wave problem in Eulerian coordinates.

  Last time we have derived the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation 

  $$\partial_t A = \mu \partial_x^3 A + \nu A \partial_x A.$$

  This talk is structured into two parts. First we will derive an explicit formula of a solitary-wave solution for the KdV equation, which is given by $$A(x,t) = v(x-ct)$$, where $$c \in \mathbb{R}$$ is the wave speed and v satisfies the ODE $$-cv' + v''' - 6vv' = 0$$ for $$\mu = -1$$ and $$\nu = 6.$$ In the second part we will discuss shortly the idea to show existence of solitary waves by variational methods.
