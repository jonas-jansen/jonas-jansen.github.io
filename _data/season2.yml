  abstract: In this talk I will introduce the classical water wave problem, modelled by the incompressible Euler equations with a free boundary (the water surface). The focus will be on the two-dimensional irrotational problem. The problem has a very long history, going back to the 18th century, but I will try to give a summary of the type of questions that have been studied by mathematicians and some important open questions that still remain.
