- title: The water-wave problem (and its many shapes)
  date: 2023-03-08
  speaker: Erik Wahlén (Lund)
  pdf: Season02-Talk01.pdf
  abstract: In this talk I will introduce the classical water wave problem, modelled by the incompressible Euler equations with a free boundary (the water surface). The focus will be on the two-dimensional irrotational problem. The problem has a very long history, going back to the 18th century, but I will try to give a summary of the type of questions that have been studied by mathematicians and some important open questions that still remain.


- title: Derivation of the KdV equation

  speaker: Bastian Hilder (Lund)
  pdf: Season02-Talk02.pdf
  abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation appears as an asymptotic model to describe the dynamics of small, long-wavelength water waves. In this talk, I will formally derive the KdV equation as an amplitude equation for the water wave problem. The derivation is based on a multiple-scaling ansatz for solutions of the water wave problem in Eulerian coordinates.

    Last time we have derived the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation 

    $$\partial_t A = \mu \partial_x^3 A + \nu A \partial_x A.$$

    This talk is structured into two parts. First we will derive an explicit formula of a solitary-wave solution for the KdV equation, which is given by \(A(x,t) = v(x-ct)\), where \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) is the wave speed and v satisfies the ODE \(-cv' + v''' - 6vv' = 0\) for \(\mu = -1\) and \(\nu = 6\). In the second part we will discuss shortly the idea to show existence of solitary waves by variational methods.

- title: Stability of solitary waves for the KdV equation
  date: 2023-04-17
  speaker: Jörg Weber (Lund)
  pdf: Season02-Talk04.pdf
  abstract: Having constructed solitary waves for KdV in the last session, the natural question to ask is whether or not they are stable. Here, due to translational invariance of the equation, one has to be careful when speaking about “stability” – the correct notion being orbital stability. In this talk, I show how our situation fits into the classical, seminal theory of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss, and thus answer the question on stability, while keeping an eye on the great, more widely applicable power of their theory.


- title: Validity of the KdV equation
  date: 2023-04-24
  speaker: Wolf-Patrick Düll (Stuttgart)
  pdf: Season02-Talk05.pdf
  abstract: In this talk, we explain how to jusitify rigorously the KdV approximation of the water wave problem with and without surface tension by proving error estimates over the physically relevant timespan. The error estimates are derived in the arc length formulation of the water wave problem, which yields bounds that are uniform with respect to the strength of the surface tension, as the height of the wave packet and the surface tension go to zero.

- title: Existence of N-solitary waves for the fractional Korteweg-de Vries equation
  date: 2023-05-02
  speaker: Arnaud Eychenne (University of Bergen)

  abstract: |
    The fractional Korteweg-de Vries equation (fKdV) equation is a dispersion generalized of the KdV equation.  As the KdV equation, the fKdV equation enjoys the existence of solitary waves and N-solitary waves. Due to the singularity of the non-local dispersion, the technics involved in proving the existence and derived properties of solitary waves and N-solitary waves are different from the one of the KdV equation (local context). 

    In the first part of the talk, we will give the results known of the solitary waves of the fKdV equation and the differences in the techniques between the local and non-local contexts. In the second part, we will present the existence of the N-solitary waves, with a short explanation of the Martel-Merle method to prove the existence of such objects and the main difficulties due to the non-locality of the dispersive operator.
